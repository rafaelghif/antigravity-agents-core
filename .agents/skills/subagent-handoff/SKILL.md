# Antigravity Subagent Handoff

Compacts the current conversation state into a structured handoff prompt and spawns an autonomous subagent via `invoke_subagent` to continue work in the background.

## Process

1. **Synthesize Handoff Prompt**:
   - Objective & current goal aligned with [memory-management.md](../../rules/memory-management.md).
   - What has been done (completed files, tests run, decisions made).
   - What remains to be done (concrete next steps).
   - Context pointers: point directly to repository files using markdown links (e.g. `[AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)` or `file:///` links in chat).
   - Suggested skills for the subagent to inspect via `view_file`.

2. **Spawn Autonomous Subagent**:
   Call `invoke_subagent` with the synthesized prompt:

   ```json
   {
     "Subagents": [
       {
         "Role": "Handoff Worker: <descriptive name>",
         "TypeName": "self",
         "Model": "flash",
         "Workspace": "inherit",
         "Prompt": "<synthesized handoff prompt>"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Confirm Launch**:
   - Inform the user that the background subagent has been dispatched with its returned `conversationId`.
   - Remind the user that progress can be monitored via `manage_subagents` (`Action: "list"`).
